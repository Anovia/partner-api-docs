## Introduction
---

Anovia's Partner API is designed to provide a simple way for parters to access data surrounding their merchant portfolio. The target audience for this document is technical teams of partners who want to consume merchant processing data for use in their own applications.

### Production Environment

Accessing your data is done via a partner specific subdomain on anoviapayments.com. Your relationship manager will provide you with your subdomain prior to launch.

    <partnerName>.anoviapayments.com/api/v1

### Development Environment

For development, we also provide a developer sandbox that can be accessed with your dev API keypair. Please see the section on Authentication for more details.

    apiTest.anoviapayments.com/api/v1

---
## Versioning
---

The Anovia Partner API uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

Version numbers can be interpreted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. 

- MAJOR version is incremented for incompatible API changes.
- MINOR version is incremented for additional functionality or fields that are backwards-compatible. __NOTE:__ The introduction of new fields is regarded as a backwards-compatible change.
- PATCH version is incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes.

---
## Glossary of Terms
---

__Lead__: A referral submitted to Anovia by a partner. A lead is still in the sales cycle, and is being actively worked by Anovia Sales. A lead can have multiple merchants.

__Merchant__: A merchant record is created when a business owner signs a merchant services agreement.

__Residual__: A monthly summary of the revenue a merchant generates for you, the partner.

__Statement__: A monthly summary of a merchant's fees, deposits, and batches.

__Fee__: A monthly amount charged for a particular transaction type, product, or service.

__Deposit__: A daily summary of funds depositied to a merchant's bank account for their processing revenue.

__Batch__: A group of authorized transactions that are submitted to the acquirer for settlement. Batches are usually settled daily, but this can also occur multiple times in a day, or every few days.

__Transaction__: A settled transaction between cardholder and merchant. Please note that only transactions that have been settled in a batch are reported at this time.

## Authentication
___

> NOTE: For security purposes, all requests to Anovia's API must be made via HTTPS

When you sign up with Anovia, you will be provided an API keypair for our TEST environment. This keypair consists of an apiKeyId and apiKeySecret. Upon completing your integration, you will be provided with a new keypair for our PRODUCTION environment.

Authentication to the Anovia Partner API is performed in one of two ways:

### Basic Auth

Create an Basic Authorization header, whose value is your API keypair, separated by a colon.

    Authorization: Basic <Base64UrlSafe(apiKeyId:apiKeySecret)>

### Bearer Auth

For an additional layer of security, you can also use tokens via a Bearer Authorization header. To receive a token, POST to {{host}}/oauth/token, with a Basic Auth header set as described above. You will receive a token that can be used in a Bearer Auth header:

    Authorization: Bearer <token>

Tokens are valid for 1 hour. If you make a request with an invalid token, you will receive a 401 response, at which point you would use your API key to request a new token.

To test authentication, you can submit a GET request to {{host}}/api. If you receive a 200 reponse code, you're doing it right.

## Endpoints

## Lead Statuses

A lead's status should give you a general idea of where the lead is in the sales process. Please keep in mind that the status of a lead is fluid. 
It can change rapidly, and changes are not always linear. For instance, a lead can be statused as 'Lost', and then return to 'Contact in Progress'
should the merchant call back and wish to resume the sales process. For this reason, we do not recommend driving automation in your systems based on 
the status of a lead.

Status                |Description
----------------------|----------
New                   |Lead received, not yet touched
Qualifying            |First contact attempted
Contact in Progress   |Decision maker reached via phone or email
Proposal Presented    |A pricing proposal has been provided to the merchant
Waiting for Info      |Anovia Account Executive is waiting on additional information from the merchant
Out for Signature     |A processing agreemtn has been provided to the merchant and is awaiting their signature
Signed                |The merchant has signed the agreement, deal has been submitted to underwriting
Lost                  |The merchant has decided not to process payments with Anovia

## Query Syntax
---

The following query params are supported on all routes that return data as a collection of objects:

__page[limit]__ - restrict the number of results returned for a colleciton query. Accepts an integer value.

    Example:
    // return no more than 20 records
    ?page[limit]=20
    
    Default: 20

__page[offset]__ - skip the first X results returned in a collection query. Most helpful when used in conjuction with __sort__. Accepts an integer value.

    Example:
    // skip the first 20 records
    ?page[offset]=20
    
    Default: 0
    
__sort__ - specify field(s) by which to sort a collection query's results. Accepts a comma separated list of field names.

    Examples:
    // sort by ASC status, then ASC name
    ?sort=status,name
    
    // sort by ASC status, then DESC name
    ?sort=status,-name
    
    // sort by DESC status, then DESC name
    ?sort=-status,-name
        
    Default: None
    
__include__ - specify which parent relationships to include in the response. In order to include a related object, the collection you are querying must have a foreign key that relates it to the object you want to include. Accepts a comma separated list of parent relationship names

    Example:
    // return an array of children and include their parent
    /children?include=parent
        
    Default: None
    
__filter[field]__ - specify criteria by which to filter the results of a collection query. Accepts operators ( wrapped in {curly braces} ) and dates, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

    Examples:
    // Date created = 01/15/2016
    ?filter[created]=2016-01-15
    
    // Date modified > 01/15/2016
    ?filter[modified]={gt}2016-01-15
    
    // Date signed >= 01/15/2016
    ?filter[signed]={gte}2016-01-15
    
    // Date approved < 01/15/2016
    ?filter[approved]={lt}2016-01-15
    
    // Date activated <= 01/15/2016
    ?filter[activated]={lte}2016-01-15
    
    // Date deactivated != 01/15/2016
    ?filter[deactivated]={ne}2016-01-15
    
    // Date signed between 01/01/2016 and 02/01/2016
    ?filter[signed]={gte}2016-01-01,{lt}2016-02-01
        
    Default: None
